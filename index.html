          <h3>From Zero to Stability: Jane’s Journey</h3>
          <p>
            After losing her job during a company layoff, Jane was unsure how to
            support her two children. With IFW's $10,000 grant and financial
            mentorship, she started a home bakery. Today, Jane earns more than
            her old salary and mentors others in her community.
